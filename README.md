# news-scraper
This is the assignment demonstrating my ability to use express, express-handlebars, mongoose, cheerio,  and axios to scrape a website. 

Note to TA grading this: I spoke with Alex and he gave me an extension on this assignment. As of right now, this subject/content confuses me since I was absent the day we went over it. For that reason, much of my code here temporarily looks very similar to the mongoose scraper activity you guys did in bootcamp while I was absent because I am just trying to follow along with how this code works! Once I get it all up and running and understand the content better, I will let you know that my homework was updated!
